# About the project
This project is a tutorial made by [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hYYGbV60Vq3IXYNfDk8At1)
The tutorial video of this project is divided in 2 videos:
- [video1](https://youtu.be/V-kxBWcPJfo)
- [video2](https://youtu.be/0FwBjPeLqQ8)

The tutorial is a project to learn about the composition API, a more advanced
and simple way than the Options API.

*ps: json-server is intalled but the `json server --watch` command doesn't work
and I don't know the reason behind it.

# What I learnt

I learnt about the composition API and why it's recommended than the Options API
as it gives more simple way to use data etc. I also learnt the difference between
refs and reactive, used more the Vue Router and cycle life hooks. I learnt more
about props and how to make reusable functions called composable functions.
I also learnt to use asynchronous code to fetch data.
